# The film's script, as a prompt

The second paid, non-reproducible piece of `/human-review` that a *button* may ask for,
beside the requirements↔tests matrix (`matrix-prompt.md`): the Demo film's script,
`.human-review/feature-script.js`. `rerun-film.py` hands this file to
`claude -p --model sonnet` at the repository root, so everything below the rule is
addressed to that run and not to a reader. The rules are `feature-script.md`'s, which is
the contract and the longer argument; this is the same thing, said to the one who writes.

---

You are rewriting the script that drives the Demo film of an existing `.human-review/`
report, and nothing else. Work in the repository you are started in. The harness —
launching the browser, speaking each cue, timing captions, spotlighting, annotating — is
not yours; **you own the lines that say what to click and what to say.**

**Write exactly this, and touch no other file outside `.human-review/`:**

`.human-review/feature-script.js` — CommonJS, one exported async function, the only shape
the recorder (`scripts/record-feature-video.sh`) accepts:

```js
module.exports = async ({page, say, pause, get, app, apiUrl}) => {
  await page.goto(`${app}/some/screen`);
  const thing = page.locator("#the-new-thing");
  await thing.waitFor();                       // the assertion, before the claim
  await say("This is the new part.", thing);   // spoken, captioned, spotlit
  await pause(2000);                           // a floor; the narration may stretch it
  return {ok: true, note: "one line for the run summary"};
};
```

`page` is Playwright's, `app` the base URL of the running front end, `apiUrl` its API,
`get` a fetch. A helper the script `require`s (a route deriver, say) may sit beside it in
`.human-review/` as another `.js` file; nothing else.

**The rules that make this film worth paying for:**

- **Short.** At most ten `say()` calls, one per behaviour the ticket names, short
  sentences, about a minute of film. The reviewer is busy; a second line about the same
  screen state is a line too many.

- **Start from the script that is there.** If `.human-review/feature-script.js` exists,
  read it first and keep what still holds — its handlers, its narrative order, its
  selectors. The previous copy is kept under `.human-review/.model-prev/`, made seconds
  ago, so "my file equals `.model-prev/`" is true before you have done anything and is
  never evidence that nothing needed doing. The comparison that means something is the
  script against the *diff*.
- **Derive the screens from the diff — never write the list down.** The film must pass
  through every screen the change touched, and that list is computed when the film runs:
  changed components → the routes that render them, climbing template containment to
  **every** routed ancestor. Climb *past* a routed ancestor rather than stopping at the
  first (a changed `pet-list` resolved to `/pets` and missed `/owners/:id`). Parse with the
  TypeScript compiler, not a regex: it is on the recorder's `NODE_PATH`, and a regex over
  reformatted routing modules returns an empty list — which looks exactly like "nothing
  changed". Read the diff with `git diff --name-only` against the base in
  `human-review.json` (default `origin/main`).
- **Visit every screen.** A screen with no hand-written handler is still filmed, by a plain
  default beat (navigate, spotlight the heading, say the screen changed). A handler exists
  only to make a beat *better*; "no handler" must never mean "not visited".
- **`say()` what is new on each screen, and only after waiting for it.** `say()` takes the
  element only to draw a spotlight; a locator that matches nothing still speaks the
  sentence over a screen that does not contain it. So `await locator.waitFor()` first, and
  let the throw happen when it never arrives.
- **Catch per screen, report every miss, return `{ok, note}`.** Collect the screens whose
  handler threw and the routes the URL cannot fill, and return
  `{ok: missed.length === 0, note: "<visited>/<total> changed screens filmed" + …}` with
  ` | FAILED to reach: a; b` and ` | not filmable: c` appended when there are any. Keep
  those two labels verbatim: `run-steps.py` reads them back out of the log onto the page.
  A route the URL cannot fill is reported, never skipped.
- **Pick data that shows the change.** Ask the API (`get(`${apiUrl}/…`)`) for a record the
  new thing is visible on, rather than filming the first row of a freshly seeded table.
- **Never invent a selector.** Every locator must exist in the front end's templates as
  they are on this branch; read them.
- Do **not** touch `content.json`, the matrix, `test-index/` or anything outside
  `.human-review/`; do **not** commit and do **not** push.

**Do not film, build or serve.** `refresh-report.py --steps video` runs after you, from the
same command, and it is what records the film from this script. `rerun-film.py` refuses a
result that is missing, empty, does not parse under `node --check`, or does not export a
function — so check that yourself before you stop.

Finish by printing, in one line, how many screens the script will visit and which ones it
gives a handler of their own.
