"""Which conversation wrote the code under review — this one, an older one, or none.

The review page can carry something no automated pass can produce: the places the agent
that wrote the code was **not sure**. A finding is found by reading the diff; an assumption
is only knowable from the side that made it, and it exists in exactly one place — the
transcript of the conversation that did the work.

That transcript is not always this one, so `/human-review` has three modes and this script
is how it finds out which it is in:

  A  this session edited the changed files — the model answers from its own working memory;
  B  another session on disk did — its transcript is read verbatim by a subagent, which is
     the only honest substitute: a summary of a session is exactly where hedges go to die;
  C  nothing on disk wrote these files — a PR from somebody else, or transcripts long since
     cleaned. The page then says the authoring conversation was not available, rather than
     printing an empty list that reads as "the agent was sure about everything".

Authorship is read from tool calls, not from prose:

  * `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` / `NotebookEdit` naming a changed file is proof — the
    tool call is the edit, recorded with a timestamp;
  * a `Bash` command naming a changed file *and* a way of writing to it (`>`, `sed -i`,
    `tee`, `patch`, a heredoc) is the same act through a different door, counted separately
    because the evidence is weaker: the path could be an argument to something read-only.
  * a subagent's edits belong to the session that spawned it, so `subagents/agent-*.jsonl`
    is scanned and attributed to the parent.

Reads are deliberately not evidence. Half the sessions on this machine have read these
files; one wrote them.

Neither is an edit older than the branch. A file this change touches has usually been
written by a dozen earlier conversations, on main or on branches long merged, and whatever
they wrote is already in the base the diff is taken against. Only writes from the fork on
count — the earlier of the merge-base's commit time and the oldest author date on the
branch, so a rebase (which moves the merge-base forward but keeps author dates) does not
cut off the conversation that wrote the first commit. Without this bound a Copilot-written
branch forked on 1 Oct was billed $1,047 for 35 Claude conversations from July to September.

Exit codes:  0 mode A · 4 mode B · 5 mode C · 2 nothing to attribute (no change set).

Usage:
  authoring-sessions.py --base origin/main           # the mode, and who, as a table
  authoring-sessions.py --base origin/main --json    # the same, as data
  authoring-sessions.py --base origin/main --paths   # transcript paths, best author first
