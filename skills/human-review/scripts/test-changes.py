"""Which tests this change set wrote, which it edited, and which it stopped running.

The Tests tab hangs a list of tests under each requirement, and a reviewer reads a *new*
test very differently from a tweaked one: the first is evidence the requirement was
pinned, the second is evidence an existing pin was moved. That distinction is a fact
about the diff, not a judgement, so it is computed here rather than asserted by whoever
writes the content file. The model's only job is to say which requirement a test belongs
to; this script says what happened to it.

The question underneath all of it is whether the branch left fewer tests running than it
found, and that has three answers, not one: a test can be deleted, commented out, or
left in place under an `@Disabled`. All three cost the run the same test, and only the
first shows up as a removal in a diff -- the other two read as "still there" to anyone
skimming. So each side is scanned for what is *declared* and for what is *switched off*,
and the page states one reconciled pair of numbers: how many tests entered the run and
how many left it, by whatever route.

The unit is a **test case**, not a file. A file that shows up as `M` in `--name-status`
usually holds one new test and nine untouched ones, and reporting the whole file as
"modified" would bury exactly the row the reviewer came for. So each side of the diff is
parsed for its test declarations, and the two name sets decide:

    in the new tree only            -> added      (a test that did not exist before)
    in the base only                -> deleted
    in both, and the diff touched
    its body                        -> modified
    in both, untouched              -> unchanged

and carries, alongside that, whether it runs now and whether it ran before:

    @Disabled / it.skip / t.Skip() -> silenced: "disabled"
    declaration only inside a comment -> silenced: "commented" (reported as deleted,
                                       because the run has lost it either way)

Line numbers are always in *working-tree* coordinates, so every row can be opened in the
editor. A deleted test has no line of its own any more, so it carries the line where its
removal landed — the point in the surviving file where the reader can see the gap. A test
in a file that was deleted outright carries no line at all and says so (`gone`). Because
unrelated code sits at that landing line, the page does not link a deleted test there: it
carries `baseLine` (its declaration at the base) and, with a GitHub `origin`, `baseUrl` —
the blob at the base commit — and that is what the page opens.

The key is the test's NAME, and nothing else. A test retitled is one test deleted and one
added, whatever its body kept: the pairing heuristics that used to fold a rename into one
`modified` row (same spot, same tags, a similar body) were a guess the reviewer could not
see, and a wrong guess hid a real deletion behind a pencil. A deleted row links to its
original at the base commit, so the reader sees both halves and judges the rename.

Usage:
    test-changes.py --base origin/main [path ...] [--out assets/test-changes.json]

With no paths, the whole repository is scanned; anything that is not recognisably a test
file is skipped either way.

# Eval run 10: AddVisitApiTest's one test kept every line of its own, while the private
# `anOwnerWithAPet()` it calls was rewritten (+14/−6) from one unpaged GET into a loop that
# walks pages and reads `.content`. The test now exercises different code, and the page
# filed it under "left exactly as they were". So a test whose own lines are untouched but
# which *directly* calls a function declared in the same file whose body the diff touched
# is `modified` too, carrying `viaHelper` — which helper, where, and how much of it moved.
#
# Conservative on purpose: same file only, a call written in the test's own lines only
# (`helper(`, `this.helper(`, `self.helper(` — not a method reference, not a helper reached
# through another helper, not a `@BeforeEach` nobody calls by name), and the helper must
# be a declaration outside every test's own lines.
