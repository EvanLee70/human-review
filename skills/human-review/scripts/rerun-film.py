"""Ask a model for the Demo film's script, and nothing else.

The second model-written artifact of `/human-review`, beside the requirements↔tests matrix:
`.human-review/feature-script.js`, the twenty-odd lines that say what to click while the
recorder films (`record-feature-video.sh`, the `video` step of `run-steps.py`). The harness
is a program; *which screens the change touched and what to say on each* is a judgement,
read off the diff, and a second pass words and orders it differently. So it is owned the
way the matrix is: `refresh-report.py` never writes it, and this is the one command that
does — `claude -p --model sonnet` over `reference/film-prompt.md`, the guidance of
`reference/feature-script.md` spelt as a prompt.

A sibling of `rerun-model.py` rather than a flag on it, because nothing about the two runs
is shared except the plumbing: a different prompt, a different artifact, a different check
that the result is usable, and a different price — so a different ledger, or the matrix's
button would quote an average over two kinds of work. The plumbing itself (the argv, the
cost field, the ledger writer) is borrowed from `rerun-model.py`, not copied.

The same three properties, for the same reasons:

- **Sonnet, named.** `HUMAN_REVIEW_MODEL` overrides it, as it does for the matrix.
- **The previous script is kept**, as `.human-review/.model-prev/feature-script.js`, before
  the model starts. A film the reader liked has to survive the click that replaced it.
- **It refuses rather than hand the recorder a broken script.** The result must exist, be
  non-empty, parse (`node --check`) and export a function — the one shape the recorder
  accepts (`typeof flow !== "function"` is its own first check). Anything else exits
  non-zero before the film step is reached, naming what is wrong and where the old one is.

    rerun-film.py                      # rewrite .human-review/feature-script.js
    rerun-film.py --dir .human-review  # …explicitly
    rerun-film.py --dry-run            # print the command, spend nothing

It does not film. The served page's 🤖 on the Demo tab — and the line its clipboard face
hands out — run `refresh-report.py --steps video --no-serve` after it, chained with `&&`
by the build's action register (`hrbuild/shared/actions.py`), so the button and the pasted
line are one string. `--dry-run` spends nothing, and every test of this file goes through it
or through a stubbed `claude`.
