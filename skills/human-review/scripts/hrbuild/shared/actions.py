# what the page is allowed to ask the server to run
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Dot-prefixed deliberately: `publish-demo.sh` publishes everything in a run directory
# that does not begin with a dot, and the downloadable zip is built from what it
# publishes. A manifest that travelled with either would be a list of this machine's
# commands sitting next to a page on someone else's, offering to run them.
ACTIONS_FILE = ".actions.json"

# Three buttons on this page describe a command and hand it to the clipboard, because a
# file on disk cannot run anything. Served by serve-review.py they can — but the command
# must not travel from the page, or "the review guide" becomes "a shell on :7654 that any
# tab in the browser can reach". So the page sends an id and the server looks the command
# up here, in a manifest written beside review.html by this build.
#
# The consequences are the point, not a side effect:
#   * a page from an older build can only name ids the *current* build still declares;
#   * the copy in the zip and the copy on GitHub Pages sit next to no manifest at all, so
#     they can ask for nothing — which is also exactly what they could do before;
#   * every command in it was written by this build out of the content file, so reviewing
#     what the button may run is reviewing the content file, which is already reviewed.
#
# A module-level register rather than a value threaded through the emitters: the three
# declarations are made by `runtime_html` and `rerun_html`, which are leaves of a render
# tree eight calls deep whose every other node is a pure string function. Passing a
# collector down that tree would put a parameter for the action server on a dozen
# signatures that have nothing to do with it. `main` clears it before a build and writes
# it after, which is the only ordering that matters.

# The two verbs the *server* owns, declared here anyway — one string, two surfaces.
#
# They used to be the exception: `serve-review.py` built its own argv for `/__rerun__`
# (`python refresh-report.py --dir … --steps static --no-serve`, run with `cwd=ROOT`) and
# the aftermath band printed its own line for the clipboard (`cd <root> && refresh-report.py
# --dir … --steps static`). Two authors, one command, and they had already drifted: the
# line a reader copied was missing `--no-serve` and the interpreter, so pasting it did
# something else than pressing it. There is no way to test that gap away while both halves
# are written twice — so neither is written twice any more.
#
# The build declares them, exactly as a reader would type them: absolute interpreter,
# absolute program, `cd <repo> &&` in front, so the string on the clipboard runs as-is in
# any terminal. The server looks them up here and runs *that string* through `sh -c`. The
# page embeds the same string in `data-cmd`. One string, three places that only read it.
#
# Dunder ids, so they can never collide with a name out of the content file, and the
# endpoints stay separate: `/__rerun__` and `/__rerun_ai__` keep the shared lock, the
# confirmation dialog and the watcher hold that `/__run__` knows nothing about. Being in
# the manifest is about *where the command lives*, not about how it is reached.
