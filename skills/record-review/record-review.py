"""The mechanical half of /record-review, so the agent spends its turns on judgement only.

The first run in VS Code Copilot Chat took 332 tool calls. Most of them were not the review:
finding where the format file lives, working out the base, re-reading the diff a hunk at a
time, composing four reviewer prompts, wiring trailers, and hand-writing seventeen PR
comments. Every one of those has exactly one right answer, so a program gives it.

  record-review.py prepare [--base REF] [--impl-subject "…"]
      Resolves the change set, commits uncommitted implementation work if asked to,
      writes the whole diff to one file and one brief per reviewer lens, and prints what
      the agent needs next — nothing else to look up.

  record-review.py finish --subject "…" [--implements SHA] [--commit-trailer "K: v"]…
      Fills review-points.md's front-matter (the audited range, the implementation
      commit, HEAD — kept apart), converts it into the structured report
      .human-review/review-points.json and validates it against
      reference/review-points.schema.json, commits the fixes with it under `[auto-fix]`
      and the trailers (plus any --commit-trailer), then derives and checks the PR
      comments.

  record-review.py ci [--push]
      Waits for CI on HEAD. Run first right after the reviewers — which also stamps the
      moment they were done — then with --push after each finish.

What the review cost is measured here too, by the harness that ran it, because only now
are its boundaries known rather than guessed: `prepare` stamps the start of the review,
the first `ci` the reviewers' end, `finish` the end of the fixes. `finish` writes the
three components — implementation (everything up to prepare, in any harness), review,
auto-fixes — to `review-cost.json` beside review-points.md, checked against
reference/review-cost.schema.json and committed with the fixes; every later `finish` (a CI
round) rewrites it with the auto-fix window run on to that round. /human-review reads it
and adds the fourth component, the guide itself (scripts/harness_cost.py).

What stays with the agent is what only it can do: run the reviewers on the briefs, accept or
decline each finding, write the assumptions it made, and edit the code it accepts.

Exit codes: 0 ok · 2 not a git repo / bad base · 3 uncommitted implementation and no
--impl-subject · 4 review-points.md missing, does not parse, or its report does not match
the schema.
